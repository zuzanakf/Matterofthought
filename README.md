#Predicting emotional response to urban sounds  

###What is this Project?
This project is a group project for The London Interdisciplinary School. It focuses on the analysis of urban sounds and their impact on human emotions, specifically in terms of arousal and valence. Utilising audio processing and machine learning techniques, we've trained linear regression models to predict emotional responses based on the characteristics of urban soundscapes.  

###Where are the Results?
The results of our analysis are compiled in the results/final_results directory. Here, you will find:

- 2D Plots: Visual representations of the models' predictions against actual data. These plots show the relationship between the feature extraction of the audio (MFCCs) and the emotional response ratings.
- Statistics: Quantitative analysis of the model's performance, including metrics such as mean squared error and the coefficient of determination (R² score).
- Evaluation: Detailed assessment of both the Valence/MFCC and Arousal/MFCC models.
